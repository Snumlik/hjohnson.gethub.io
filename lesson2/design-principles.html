      <p>Squarespace, a web development company, strategially used a bold image as their homepage. The image has
         excellent photographic composition, utilizing nuetral tones making it applicable to most users, gantastic
         framing, and exemplifies the rule of thirds. Squarespace has further played on this rule of thids by framing a
         portion of the image within a mock-viewport. The image within this frame is also following the rule of thirds,
         and the frame within the user's screen is also following the rule of thirds. </p>
