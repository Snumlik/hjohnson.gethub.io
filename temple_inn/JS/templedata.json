    "history": "The Preston England Temple was the sixth temple built in Europe and the second built in the United Kingdom, following the London England Temple (1958).  Missionary work in the British Isles began in 1837 when Elder Heber C. Kimball, an apostle, and six others arrived at Liverpool and traveled to Preston to pursue a contact with a family of Joseph Fielding. The first converts in Great Britain were baptized that year in Preston's River Ribble. On August 6, 1837, the Preston Ward was organized, which is the longest continuously functioning unit of the Church in the world.  Plans for the Preston England Temple were publicly announced by President Gordon B. Hinckley on October 19, 1992, during the second day of rededicatory services for the London England Temple.",

    "history": "Missionaries of the Church first arrived in Sapporo in 1905. By 1924, the mission had closed, leaving behind a handful of members—most of whom could not be located following World War II. When the mission reopened in 1948, missionaries returned to Hokkaidō, and the Church began to grow. As early as the 1960s, Hokkaidō members held to a belief that a temple would be built among them one day as described at the groundbreaking ceremony by Elder Koichi Aoyagi in a reflection of his own missionary experience there: 'I was a missionary here in Hokkaidō 46 years ago. The members in the Sapporo Branch back then said to me, 'Someday we will build a temple in Sapporo.' I am happy that this day has come.  On July 17, 1949, Elder Matthew Cowley made the first prophecy regarding the temples of Japan during the dedicatory services for the old Tokyo mission home—now the site of the Tokyo Japan Temple. Elder Harrison Ted Price, a missionary serving in the Northern Far East Mission, recorded in his journal: 'In this prayer, he told of countless blessings from the Lord that have been enjoyed here to date, and went on to prophesy—'there will someday be many church buildings—and even TEMPLES built in the land.'",

    "history": "The St. Louis Missouri Temple was the first temple built in Missouri, though temple sites were dedicated in the 1830s in Independence, Far West, and Adam-ondi-Ahman.  The site for the St. Louis Missouri Temple was approved by each member of the First Presidency. Each was individually escorted to six possible sites, and each in turn selected the same site to build the temple.  Nearly 5,000 people gathered to witness the groundbreaking for the St. Louis Missouri Temple on an exceptionally cold and breezy day. 'This may sound strange,' said President Gordon B. Hinckley who presided over the services, 'but I am rather glad it is cold. I think it brings us to a greater appreciation for the Saints who left the state of Missouri in 1838 under the orders of the then governor; a tragic episode in the history of our people, and I think that it must be so for Missouri.'  Construction of the St. Louis Missouri Temple was well received by residents and enthusiastically welcomed by the mayor, aldermen, and alderwoman of Town and Country and other local officials. Their warm reception reflected the refuge found in St. Louis in the 1830s when Saints fled from persecution in Western Missouri and Illinois.  Extensive news coverage was given to the St. Louis Missouri Temple open house including a front-page story in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and a full-page article in USA Today with graphics representing the interior floor plan.  U.S. Senator Christopher Bond was among the participants in VIP tours preceding the public open house. While serving as governor of Missouri in 1976, it was he who rescinded the infamous extermination order issued in 1838 by Governor Lilburn W. Boggs commanding Latter-day Saints to leave the state within 30 days under threat of extermination.  During the four-week public open house of the St. Louis Missouri Temple, nearly 260,000 visitors toured the building with 11,518 on the first day alone. Demand for the free tickets was so high that tours were conducted on two of the four Sundays, though it was originally planned that no tours would be held on Sundays. Reaction was overwhelmingly positive with visitors demonstrating genuine interest and curiosity.  The St. Louis Missouri Temple was dedicated in 19 sessions over a five-day period. President Gordon B. Hinckley presided over the first two days, then President James E. Faust over the next day and a half, and President Thomas S. Monson over the final day and a half.",

    "history": "In his opening remarks of General Conference, held October 1, 2005, President Gordon B. Hinckley announced plans for the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple, the fourth in the Salt Lake Valley. He also noted that a site had been acquired for a fifth Salt-Lake-area temple in the southwest part of the valley, which has been set aside for a future announcement.  On Tuesday, November 28, 2006, the South Jordan Planning Commission wholeheartly approved plans for the temple, which drew rave reviews from city staff and zero public comment.2 Plans called for a 60,000-square-foot building with 63-foot high walls and a single spire reaching 193 feet heavenward, topped by the traditional gold-leafed angel Moroni statue.  On December 16, 2006, President Hinckley presided at the groundbreaking ceremony where he announced the official name of the temple as the Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple. It has been previously called the South Jordan Utah Temple. The beautiful Oquirrh Mountains form the western boundary of the Salt Lake Valley.",
